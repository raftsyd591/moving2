*   **Meta Tags:** Unique, compelling Meta Titles (under 60 chars) and Meta Descriptions (under 160 chars) for every page, in Arabic.
*   **URL Structure:** Clean, short, SEO-friendly URLs (Arabic or transliterated English, be consistent). E.g., `/services/naql-athath-manzili` or `/خدمات/نقل-أثاث-منزلي`.
*   **Internal Linking:** Strategically link between relevant pages and blog posts to distribute link equity and improve navigation.
*   **Image Optimization:** Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `naql-afsh-riyadh-truck.jpg`) and ALT text in Arabic for all images. Compress images for speed.
*   **Mobile-First Responsive Design:** Crucial for Google KSA.
*   **Site Speed (Core Web Vitals):** Optimize for LCP, FID, CLS.
*   **Schema Markup:** Implement relevant schema:
    *   `LocalBusiness` (and `MovingCompany` subtype) for the business.
    *   `Service` for each service page.
    *   `Article` for blog posts.
    *   `FAQPage` for the FAQ section.
    *   `Review` or `AggregateRating` for testimonials.
*   **XML Sitemap & Robots.txt:** Properly configured.
*   **Google Analytics & Search Console:** Setup from day one.
*   **Accessibility (WCAG):** Adhere to basic accessibility standards.

## 5. Content Tone & Style:

*   **Primary Language:** Arabic (Saudi dialect preferred).
*   **Tone:** Professional, trustworthy, reassuring, helpful, empathetic to the stress of moving.
*   **Clarity:** Simple, direct language. Avoid jargon.
*   **Cultural Sensitivity:** Content should be respectful and relevant to the Saudi Arabian context.

## 6. Deliverables from AI:

1.  Detailed sitemap outline.
2.  For each key page:
    *   H1 proposal.
    *   List of H2/H3 sections with brief content pointers.
    *   Suggestions for CTA placement.
    *   Thematic suggestions for image placement using the provided path structure (e.g., "Use image `/public/images/hero-ksa.jpg` for the homepage hero section depicting...").
3.  Blog category suggestions.
4.  5-7 example blog post titles with brief outlines and target keywords. Indicate which blog image path prefix (`/images/blog/`) and author image path prefix (`/images/author/`) to consider.
5.  Key SEO considerations summary.

This prompt should give Cursor AI a very solid foundation to build a professional and SEO-optimized website structure. Remember to manually verify and refine the AI's output, especially for cultural nuances and specific business details.


Key considerations for you when implementing:

Image Files: Ensure the image filenames you have match the thematic suggestions or adapt the suggestions. For instance, if Cursor AI suggests /images/blog/packing-fragiles.jpg for a blog post on packing, make sure you have an image with that name (or similar and update the reference) in your public/images/blog/ directory.

Arabic Content: While the prompt asks for English for development ease, the final site needs excellent Arabic. The AI can help draft this, but human review and refinement by a native Arabic speaker with knowledge of Saudi dialects will be essential.

Local SEO Specifics: Truly dominating local SEO for each governorate will require more than just a webpage. It involves Google Business Profile optimization, local citations, and localized content beyond just the page itself.

"April 2025 Updates": Since these are hypothetical, the prompt focuses on established and forward-looking best practices (E-E-A-T, UX, Helpful Content), which are always critical.

This detailed prompt gives Cursor AI the structure, context, and specific instructions it needs to generate a high-quality blueprint. Good luck!

## Image Paths

When adding new blog images, follow these guidelines:

- Always place blog images in `/public/images/blog/` directory
- Use **underscores** (not hyphens) in image filenames: `example_image_name.jpeg`
- Prefer `.jpeg` format for blog post images
- Use lowercase for all filenames
- Make sure image dimensions are optimized for web (recommended: 1200x800px)

For article markdown:
```
